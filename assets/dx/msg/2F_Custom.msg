As we speak, he is doing battle[BR]
with the foul creature in the[BR]
bowels of the Ancient Colossus.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Few know of the existence of[BR]
that place. Even fewer know[BR]
of its true purpose.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
While it is true that place[BR]
is a prison, the truth runs[BR]
far deeper.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
There exists another world,[Pause 15][BR]
another existence,[Pause 15] created[BR]
by the Star Rod.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
The Colossus merely serves as[BR]
a seal, keeping evil locked[BR]
away in that other world.[BR]

Pardon me, but my memory of[BR]
the subject may be a bit hazy.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Ahem.[Pause 20] First, a Great[BR]
Emperor tried to conquer the[BR]
Mushroom Kingdom.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Then the Star Spirits asked[BR]
your family to create a tool,[BR]
nay, a weapon to defeat this[BR]
Emperor.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Then they wished for an end to[BR]
the Emperor, a selfish wish.[BR]
This created Disastar, an[BR]
evil beyond imagine.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
It was my understanding that[BR]
Disastar killed the Emperor[BR]
and all who followed him.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Then Disastar was sealed away[BR]
in the Ancient Colossus,[BR]
and locked by a door only[BR]
you could open.[BR]
[Wait][End]
}

#message:2F:(MSG_DonlonAnswer) {
[Style Right]
Indeed, The Star Spirits asked[BR]
my family to create a weapon.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
However, misusing the weapon[BR]
had consequences. By making a[BR]
selfish wish, they brought[BR]
forth a terrible evil.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
This terrible evil was fueled[BR]
by the selfish wishes of the[BR]
Emperor, and was thus able[BR]
to defeat him.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
And yet, the Great Emperor's[BR]
death was never confirmed.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Disastar failed to destroy the[BR]
Emperor.[Pause 10] Instead, it created[BR]
a corrupted world to seal[BR]
him away.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Then we sealed Disastar in[BR]
the Ancient Colossus, along[BR]
with many of the Emperor's[BR]
followers.[BR]
[Wait][End]

#message:2F:(MSG_DonlonContinue) {

But the Emperor has grown too[BR]
poweful for Disastar to hold[BR]
any longer.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
If Disastar loses his grip on[BR]
The Emperor, he will be freed[BR]
from his prison.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
The time has come for both to[BR]
be destroyed![BR]

Ah, Luigi. You are the newest[BR]

Yes, you do. The rest of you[BR]
will be sent to destroy the[BR]
Emperor, or die trying.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
He is far more powerful than[BR]
you are now. You will need to[BR]
find a way to grow stronger.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
What's more, when I send you[BR]
to this other world, [Color 0x20]you will[BR]
all lose your bond to the[BR]
Star Spirits[Color 0x0A].[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Without that bond, you will[BR]
all lose much of your power.[BR]
[Color 0x20]You'll need to regain this bond[BR]
if you wish to survive[Color 0x0A].[BR]
[Wait][Next]
I have given you my medalion.[BR]
Wearing it will cause all of[BR]
your enemies to weaken.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
Then again, I know the Dojo[BR]
prides itself on strength and[BR]
honor above all else.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
If you wish for a true[BR]
challenge, you can always[BR]
opt to leave it unequipped.[BR]
[Wait][Next]
I am needed elsewhere, if there[BR]
are no questions, I'll go ahead[BR]
and send you on your way now.[BR]
